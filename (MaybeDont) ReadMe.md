#  TrainHack 2017

## Entertrainer 


I really didnt have much plan (nothing more than a grand idea) when i got into the train for TrainHack 2017. But things fell into place as Jens and Anton walked right into the same kupe as i was in and we just started talking about each of our ideas. Surprisingly it was a close match.

So we just got down to form the team "Entertrainer" and started hacking.

Oh boy, Both Anton and Jens were pretty quick in fixing whatever came in to our discussion into an API feed.

All in all, it was a fun ride to Lule√• and the time just flew by we just pulled off the demo with basic features of showing the stations along the route and some info for them. In addition, the traffic disturbances from the local area is also shown (Thanks to SR API)

Disclaimer:
This code is by no means perfect. There maybe some nice things. But there are more quick fixes, temporary fixes, intentional debts etc. When you find something bothers you, i think its a good conversation starter for us to start talking :)
